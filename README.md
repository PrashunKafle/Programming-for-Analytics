# Programming for Analytics  
Learning how to use Python for real-world data analysis, visualization, and decision-making.

In CIS 372 – Programming for Analytics, I’m developing practical skills in using Python for data analysis and decision-making. The course emphasizes working with 
libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib to clean, analyze, and visualize data. Through hands-on assignments and two major projects, I’m learning how to turn 
raw data into clear, meaningful insights presented through well-structured Jupyter Notebooks. This class is helping me build a strong foundation in analytical thinking,
data wrangling, and communicating results effectively.
